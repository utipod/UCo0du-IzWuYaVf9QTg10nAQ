      <description><![CDATA[A new exercise we uploaded to the Strength Training app, Biceps Curl with Hip Abduction using a Resistance Band.

The target muscles are the biceps brachii and gluteus medius (colored red).
The abdominals and other core muscles assist in maintaining normative curvatures.
The ability to stand on one leg is important.
Improving your balance can help improve sports performance.

How to do it?
In a standing position, place the band under the feet and hold the other end in one hand. Bend the elbow and at the same time abduct the opposite leg.

In addition to strengthening these muscles, an equally important aim is to strengthen the core muscles and improve balance.

      <description><![CDATA[The Rectus Abdominins is the muscle in charge of PPT (posterior pelvic tilt) and spine flexion.
It’s a popular muscle to target for aesthetic reasons, and many trainees ask specifically to work in this muscle. It’s important to remember it’s just one part of the abdominal muscles, and not forget to strengthen and target all the abdominal muscles.
In this video you’ll see the connection between the hips and spine, learn how to avoid an unnecessary over spine flexion, and an anatomical analysis of 3 different exercises.

      <description><![CDATA[Plank with leg raises | Anatomical Analysis

This exercise is intended to strengthen the core muscles, with an emphasis on the oblique abdominals and hip flexors of the supported leg.

Breaking leg contact adds to the difficulty level of the exercise.

The external oblique is dominant on the side of the lifted leg, and the internal oblique is dominant on the side of the supporting leg.

All the muscles on the model stabilize the body.
We chose to color the rectus abdominis and the obliques in red because they are the dominant stabilizers in this exercise. But this exercise is not intended only for the abdominals but for all the core muscles.

      <description><![CDATA[Biceps Curl, Single Leg Deadlift Stance / Bent Over Stance.

The exercise is intended to strengthen the elbow flexors dynamically, strengthen the posterior chain statically, and improve balance.

The target muscle is the biceps brachii (red).
The brachialis and brachioradialis assist in elbow flexion.

The erector spinae, transversus abdominis and the other core muscles stabilize the torso.

The posterior chain stabilizes the pelvis, spine and hip joint.
A strong posterior chain is essential for building good movement patterns, solid strength and bodily support in your workout.

      <description><![CDATA[The Hanging Leg Raises (or Hanging Hip Flexion) is a powerful exercise meant to strengthen both the Iliopsoas and the Abdominal muscles.
Adding a PPT as a second part of the exercise focuses the load on the Rectus Abdominis. 

In this video, you’ll see a detailed anatomical analysis, how the abs engage in each part of the exercise, and a common mistake to avoid.

Intelligent training will help you get better results with fewer injuries!

      <description><![CDATA[Plank With Side Step
Anatomical Analysis

This exercise is intended to strengthen the core muscles, with an emphasis on the oblique abdominals and hip flexors of the supporting leg, breaking leg contact adds to the difficulty level of the exercise!

Start with an elbow plank.
Break leg contact from the floor and move it sideways.
Bring the second leg to the first, and repeat the same movement with the second leg.

The external oblique is dominant on the side of the lifted leg, and the internal oblique is dominant on the side of the supporting leg.

All the muscles on the model stabilize the body. We chose to color the rectus abdominis and the obliques in red because they are the dominant stabilizers in this exercise. But this exercise is not intended only for the abdominals but for all the core muscles working in coordination.

Characteristic mistake: Anterior pelvic tilt.
The reason is compensation for weakness in the abdominal muscles or lack of awareness.

Why is it preferable to maintain a STRAIGHT BACK/ BODY ALIGNMENT?
 
Straight back or body alignment refers to a neutral position of the spine, which we have when our posture is ideal and the spine maintains its normative curves.

In this condition, the core muscles are coordinated neurologically and have maximal ability to stabilize the spine! They have perfect ability to stabilize the spine and respond to even the smallest movement.

      <description><![CDATA[Single-Leg Glute Bridge with Hip Flexion

An exercise that combines hip extension with hip flexion.
Attach one foot to a resistance band or cable and lie on your back.
Push the flexed leg against the floor and raise the pelvis. At the same time bring the knee of the other leg toward the chest and pull the resistance band.
The target muscles are the gluteus maximus and hip flexors (red). 
In addition to strengthening these muscles, another aim of the exercise is to strengthen the core muscles and the hip stabilizers.

Anatomical analysis:
The gluteus maximus extends the hip joint.
The iliopsoas and other hip flexors flex the hip.
The quadriceps femoris extends the knee.
The rectus femoris of the pulling leg flexes the hip.
The erector spinae, transversus abdominis, and the other core muscles stabilize the torso.

An exercise intended to strengthen the elbow flexors using the eccentric method.

Flex your elbow, take one step backward and stretch the band. Extend the elbow slowly between 3-5 seconds and return to the starting position. The eccentric emphasis training method provides a unique external load methodology by slowing the lowering or eccentric loading phase of an exercise. As a training stimulus, this increase of the time under tension elicits change in muscles that improve their strength, function, and size. In this animation, we show the classic overload eccentric technique. Choose a band that gives a resistant level of 6-8 reps. After stretching the band, its tension should be around 1 RM. In other words, in this position, the resistance band is pulled so tight that you can't do more than one full concentric contraction. Note this load is suitable for advanced exercisers. If you are a novice trainee, it is not necessary to make the band too tight. Light resistance is enough. Working with the band allows us to increase the resistance in the eccentric part without help from a partner and to return easily to the beginning position in order to perform concentric contraction.
