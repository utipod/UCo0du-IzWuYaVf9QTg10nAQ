      <description><![CDATA[A new exercise we uploaded to the Strength Training app, Biceps Curl with Hip Abduction using a Resistance Band.

The target muscles are the biceps brachii and gluteus medius (colored red).
The abdominals and other core muscles assist in maintaining normative curvatures.
The ability to stand on one leg is important.
Improving your balance can help improve sports performance.

How to do it?
In a standing position, place the band under the feet and hold the other end in one hand. Bend the elbow and at the same time abduct the opposite leg.

In addition to strengthening these muscles, an equally important aim is to strengthen the core muscles and improve balance.

      <description><![CDATA[Biceps Curl, Single Leg Deadlift Stance / Bent Over Stance.

The exercise is intended to strengthen the elbow flexors dynamically, strengthen the posterior chain statically, and improve balance.

The target muscle is the biceps brachii (red).
The brachialis and brachioradialis assist in elbow flexion.

The erector spinae, transversus abdominis and the other core muscles stabilize the torso.

The posterior chain stabilizes the pelvis, spine and hip joint.
A strong posterior chain is essential for building good movement patterns, solid strength and bodily support in your workout.
