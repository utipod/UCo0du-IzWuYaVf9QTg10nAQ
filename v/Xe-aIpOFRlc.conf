description = "Plank With Side Step\nAnatomical Analysis\n\nThis exercise is intended to strengthen the core muscles, with an emphasis on the oblique abdominals and hip flexors of the supporting leg, breaking leg contact adds to the difficulty level of the exercise!\n\nStart with an elbow plank.\nBreak leg contact from the floor and move it sideways.\nBring the second leg to the first, and repeat the same movement with the second leg.\n\nThe external oblique is dominant on the side of the lifted leg, and the internal oblique is dominant on the side of the supporting leg.\n\nAll the muscles on the model stabilize the body. We chose to color the rectus abdominis and the obliques in red because they are the dominant stabilizers in this exercise. But this exercise is not intended only for the abdominals but for all the core muscles working in coordination.\n\nCharacteristic mistake: Anterior pelvic tilt.\nThe reason is compensation for weakness in the abdominal muscles or lack of awareness.\n\nWhy is it preferable to maintain a STRAIGHT BACK/ BODY ALIGNMENT?\n \nStraight back or body alignment refers to a neutral position of the spine, which we have when our posture is ideal and the spine maintains its normative curves.\n\nIn this condition, the core muscles are coordinated neurologically and have maximal ability to stabilize the spine! They have perfect ability to stabilize the spine and respond to even the smallest movement.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen you understand better, you can explain and teach better!\nEnrich your knowledge â€“ Understand the Anatomy of Strength Training\n\nIf you want to try the Strength Training app, click the link below:\n\nhttps://www.muscleandmotion.com/products/strength-training-app/"
