description = "ECCENTRIC BICEPS CURL with Resistance Band\nLearn more: www.muscleandmotion.com/updates\n\nAn exercise intended to strengthen the elbow flexors using the eccentric method.\n\nFlex your elbow, take one step backward and stretch the band. Extend the elbow slowly between 3-5 seconds and return to the starting position. The eccentric emphasis training method provides a unique external load methodology by slowing the lowering or eccentric loading phase of an exercise. As a training stimulus, this increase of the time under tension elicits change in muscles that improve their strength, function, and size. In this animation, we show the classic overload eccentric technique. Choose a band that gives a resistant level of 6-8 reps. After stretching the band, its tension should be around 1 RM. In other words, in this position, the resistance band is pulled so tight that you can't do more than one full concentric contraction. Note this load is suitable for advanced exercisers. If you are a novice trainee, it is not necessary to make the band too tight. Light resistance is enough. Working with the band allows us to increase the resistance in the eccentric part without help from a partner and to return easily to the beginning position in order to perform concentric contraction.\n\nTry our Strength Training app and watch more than 800 exercises\nhttps://www.muscleandmotion.com/products/strength-training-app/\n\nWhen you understand better, you can explain and teach better!"
