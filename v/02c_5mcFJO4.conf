description = "A new exercise we uploaded to the Strength Training app, Biceps Curl with Hip Abduction using a Resistance Band.\n\nThe target muscles are the biceps brachii and gluteus medius (colored red).\nThe abdominals and other core muscles assist in maintaining normative curvatures.\nThe ability to stand on one leg is important.\nImproving your balance can help improve sports performance.\n\nHow to do it?\nIn a standing position, place the band under the feet and hold the other end in one hand. Bend the elbow and at the same time abduct the opposite leg.\n\nIn addition to strengthening these muscles, an equally important aim is to strengthen the core muscles and improve balance.\n\nMuscle and Motion's apps available for any movement professional looking to take his knowledge one step forward!\n\nFor more videos, be sure to subscribe to our channel here on youtube at the link below, and donâ€™t forget to turn on notifications so you never miss one.\nYouTube - https://www.youtube.com/user/MuscleandMotion\n\nWANT EXCLUSIVE VIDEOS NOT FOUND ON YOUTUBE?\n\nTry the Strength Training app today on all devices!\nhttps://www.muscleandmotion.com/products/strength-training-app/\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\nFOLLOW US ON:\nYouTube - https://www.youtube.com/user/MuscleandMotion\nInstagram (1M followers) - https://www.instagram.com/muscleandmotion/\nFacebook (2M followers) - https://www.facebook.com/muscleandmotion\n\nThe Muscle and Motion team\nhttps://www.muscleandmotion.com/"
